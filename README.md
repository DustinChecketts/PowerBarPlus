# Power Bar Plus

A World of Warcraft: Classic (Anniversary, Seasons, Hardcore, Era) addon that helps mana-using classes monitor and maintain mana efficiency.

Power Bar Plus helps you manage your MP5 with a five-second rule (FSR) countdown, tick countdown, and mana regenerated per tick. All of this in a seamless, lightweight addon that integrates seamlessly into Blizzard's native UI in a sleek and stylish way.

<h4>Features</h4>

- Counts down the five-second rule (FSR) for MP5 to kick in
- Tracks each mana tick so you know when more mana is incoming
- Displays the amount of mana gained each tick
- Plug and play integration, no setup required
- Integrates seamlessly into the default Blizzard UI
